# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global video game sales to identify patterns that influence a game’s commercial success. As an analyst for the online store Ice, the goal is to understand which factors — such as platform, genre, release year, and review scores — drive higher sales and can guide future advertising strategy.

The dataset includes 16,715 records of games released between 1980–2016, with regional sales, critic/user reviews, and ESRB ratings.

### 🧹 Data Preparation

#### ✔️ Key Cleaning Steps

- Standardized column names

- Converted year_of_release to Int64

- Converted user_score to numeric (handling "tbd" automatically)

- Created total_sales as the sum of all regional sales

- Added review‑status categories to preserve meaning in missing values

#### ✔️ Missing Value Insights

- Over 50% of games lack critic or user reviews

- Missing reviews are not random — older games and low‑visibility titles are less likely to have them

- Games with both critic and user reviews have significantly higher average sales

- Missing values were kept as‑is because the absence of reviews is itself meaningful

### 📈 Key Findings

#### 🎮 1. Game Releases Over Time

- Releases peaked between 2005–2011, with over 1,000 games per year

- After 2011, releases dropped by 56%, but critic scores improved, suggesting higher quality

- Nintendo dominated peak years (Wii + DS = 2,374 games)

#### 🎭 2. Genre Trends

Genres with the highest releases and sales during peak years:

- Action

- Sports

- Miscellaneous (e.g., Wii Party, Just Dance)

- Shooter

#### 🌍 3. Regional Sales Patterns

- North America consistently leads in sales volume

- Europe follows closely

- Japan shows strong preference for RPGs and Nintendo platforms

### 🎮 PS4 Review Score Analysis

To understand how reviews affect sales on a modern platform, I analyzed PS4 games separately.

### 🔍 Correlation Results

- Critic Score vs Sales: 0.432

- User Score vs Sales: 0.024

### 📝 Interpretation

- Critic reviews have a moderate positive relationship with sales

- User reviews have almost no relationship with sales

- Critic scores likely influence early purchasing decisions and marketing

- User scores accumulate later and vary widely in reliability

### 🧠 Conclusions

- The video game market experienced a major boom from 2005–2011, followed by consolidation

- Fewer releases after 2011 corresponded with higher average critic scores

- Action, Sports, Misc, and Shooter genres consistently dominate sales

- Critic reviews matter far more than user reviews for predicting sales

- Nintendo platforms played a major role in shaping the peak years of the industry
